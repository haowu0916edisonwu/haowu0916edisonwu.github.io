# Major Project 1: Building a Website

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this project is to give you hands-on experience creating a website using technology skills (e.g., HTML and CSS) covered in class.

## Deliverables
- A zipped file with all HTML, CSS, image files, and other resources (if any)
- A URL to your website on `xxxxx.github.io` (as a comment on the submission page)

> **Note:** The file structure and contents of the ZIP file you upload should be the same as those on GitHub.

## Grade
- **Total:** 20 points

## Description
Hand-encode (NO Dreamweaver, NO WordPress, NO Square Space! Just you and your text editor!) a valid HTML website containing:
1. A **home page**
2. At least **FOUR additional interlinked pages** (e.g., one page each about your favorite movie, cuisine, and book)

Each bullet point below corresponds to a grading criterion. Completing one earns the associated points; missing it results in a deduction. Items not listed will not be considered in grading (e.g., visual aesthetics).

> Unless otherwise specified, each requirement only needs to be implemented once across the entire website.

## Website Requirements

Your website must include:

- ✅ **5 interlinked pages**: one home page and at least four additional pages
- ✅ **Correct HTML structure** on all pages:
  - `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration
  - `<title>` element
  - At least **two levels of heading elements** (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.)
  - At least one **paragraph**
  - **Styling changes** in at least 4 elements (e.g., bold, font size)
  - A **list** (ordered or unordered)
  - A **description list** (`<dl>`)
  - **Three images** (not background images)
  - A **hyperlink** to an external website with meaningful link text
  - **Alt tags** for all images for accessibility
  - A `<nav>` section on **each page** with links to all other pages

---

## CSS Requirements

Add an **external CSS stylesheet** linked by all pages. It must include:

- Change the font for at least one element to a **serif font** (not browser default), with `"serif"` as fallback
- Set a **background color** OR use a **full-page background image**
- Add **spacing** (margin or padding) around page content
- At least **one page** must have a **unique layout**

---

## Validation

- All HTML pages must **validate with no errors** (alerts are OK) using [WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/)

---

## Image Usage Guidelines

- Prefer using images that **belong to you** (e.g., photos you’ve taken)
- If using images you don’t own:
  1. Find images with an **appropriate license** (recommended: Creative Commons)
  2. Provide **attribution** using the format:

    ```
    Background image: {title} by {creator} at {URL}, {CC license abbreviation}.
    ```

    **Example:**
    > Background image: *Flower* by Adam Blackbourn at [https://www.adamblackbourn.com/flower.jpg](https://www.adamblackbourn.com/flower.jpg), CC BY-NC-ND.
